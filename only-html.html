<h1>Hi, I'm Behiye,</h1>
<p>Generally, I work on Deep Learning Models and Robotic Projects. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Now,</h3>
<p>I work on <strong>SSinvader</strong> project. It is just for fun and to tease myself. </p>
<p>I have <strong>639</strong> screenshots on my computer and <strong>937</strong> screenshots on my phone.  </p>
<p>I am taking them to check later. </p>
<p >I can not delete because there can be important information.</p>
<img width="250" height="390" title="screenshots folder on my computer" src="./data/ss-comp.jpg" alt="screenshots folder on my computer">
<img width="250" height="420" title="screenshots folder on my phone" src="./data/ss-phone.jpg" alt="screenshots folder on my phone">
<hr>
<h3>My Plan,</h3>
<p>is destroy my screenshots. </p>
<p>I code with Python.</p>
<p>For that, I will use Image Augmentation Library. You can check on <a color:red href="https://github.com/aleju/imgaug">Github</a>. .</p>
<p>I will use different augmentation types and augmentation rates as seen in the video.</p>

<video width="640" height="480" controls>
    <source src="./data/imgaug.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
  

<hr>
<h3>Methods;</h3>
<ul>
    <li>They can be destroyed by increasing augmentation rate depending on elapsed time since creating time.</li>
    <li>They can be destroyed by random augmentation rate.</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<h3>If,</h3>
<p>You have same size of folder. </p>
<p>Follow this <a href="https://github.com/erdemirbehiye/SSinvader.git">repository</a>.</p>
<h4 >I will have to hurry a little to check that very important information.</h4>
